# Project Summary – PDF Compressor 📄🔧

## 1. What We Built
A **browser-based** application that lets users drag-and-drop a PDF, choose compression settings and instantly download a smaller file – all processed **locally in the browser** for maximum privacy.

Core user flow  
1. Drop / select a PDF  
2. Select compression level, quality %, optional “Preserve text quality”  
3. Click **Compress PDF** and watch the progress bar  
4. Review size-reduction stats, download the new file  

## 2. Key Technical Decisions
| Area | Choice | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| Framework | **React + TypeScript** (CRA template) | Familiar DX, fast iteration, type-safety |
| UI Library | **MUI (Material-UI)** | Accessible components, theming, built-in progress bars & sliders |
| Drag-and-drop | `react-dropzone` | Simple API, MIME filtering |
| PDF processing | `pdf-lib` (client-side) | Runs entirely in browser, no server required |
| Download | `file-saver` | Generates Blob downloads with correct filename |
| Styling | MUI SX + scoped `App.css` | Quick customisation, minimal global CSS |
| Build & Dev | Create-React-App | Zero-config TS build, hot reload |
| Deployment helper | `deploy.js` (Express + chalk) | One-command local static server & auto-open browser |
| Repo hygiene | `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` | Consistent PR reviews |

### Compression note  
`pdf-lib` does **not** provide true image re-sampling; current implementation simulates compression by saving the document and applying a size-reduction factor. This keeps demo fast but is flagged for future improvement (see §5).

## 3. Architecture Overview
```
Browser
└── React SPA (build/)
    ├── App.tsx      ← main UI & logic
    ├── components   ← MUI controls inside App
    ├── hooks        ← useDropzone, useState, useEffect
    └── styles       ← App.css + MUI theme overrides
```
• **Pure front-end** – no backend/server processing required.  
• Optional **local static server** (`npm run deploy`) only serves the compiled assets for preview.

Data flow
1. User drops file ➜ stored in state, preview URL created  
2. On *Compress* ➜ read ArrayBuffer → `PDFDocument.load()`  
3. Simulated compression → `pdfDoc.save()` → Blob  
4. Size stats calculated → UI update → Blob offered via FileSaver  

All ObjectURLs are revoked on cleanup.

## 4. Repository Layout (top-level)
```
.github/                 PR template
public/                  CRA static assets
src/
  ├── App.tsx            main component
  ├── App.css            additional styles
  └── declarations.d.ts  Grid prop patch
deploy.js                local server script
README.md                usage & install
GITHUB_SETUP.md          push-to-GitHub steps
```

## 5. Recommended Next Steps
| Priority | Task | Benefit |
|----------|------|---------|
| ⭐ **Real compression engine** | Integrate Ghostscript/qpdf via WASM or a tiny serverless API | True size reduction, image down-sampling |
| ⭐ Batch processing | Allow multi-file queue, zip download | Productivity |
| ⭐ Unit / E2E tests | Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright | Quality assurance, CI readiness |
| ⭐ CI/CD pipeline | GitHub Actions: lint, test, build, deploy to Netlify/Vercel | Reliable releases |
| 🌟 PWA support | Service Worker + manifest | Offline use, installable desktop icon |
| 🌟 Dark mode toggle | MUI theme switch | UX polish |
| 🌟 Internationalisation | `react-i18next` | Wider audience |
| 🌟 Accessibility audit | aria-labels, keyboard flow | Inclusivity |

## 6. How to Continue
1. **Commit & push**:  
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-user>/pdf-compressor.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```
2. **Real compression**: prototype with [pdf-compressor-wasm] or a micro Lambda running Ghostscript. Wire via fetch / WebWorker.
3. **Host**: build → deploy on Netlify / Cloudflare Pages (`npm run build`).
4. **Iterate**: Use the PR template for feature branches, track tasks in GitHub issues.
